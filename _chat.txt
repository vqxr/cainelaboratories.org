For endometriosis
[24/02/2026, 16:09:54] ~ Haziq: We gotta mine this dataset 
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01873-w
To find any cell surface markers  that we can target and cross reference to tabula sapiens to make sure it’s not broadly expressed and then we cook

Dual targeting CAR is also a thing now so we can try to find combinations as well, that might improve the safety profile

[25/02/2026, 08:47:47] abdurrahman: CAR feels almost too straightforward for a hackathon tbh.

If we’re already mining the nature genetics dataset and filtering against tabula sapiens, we basically have to implement a lesion specific synNotch to CAR circuit, or even a spatial transcriptomics informed AND/NOT logic gate that actively suppresses activation in any healthy stromal context, there’s no way around it if we want this to work.

Also I can’t access the first nature paper, could you send the PDF?
[25/02/2026, 10:13:54] abdurrahman: ‎You deleted this message.

[25/02/2026, 13:24:08] ~ Haziq: Broooo that’s 100% true, CAR T is not bleeding edge bioengineering in 2026 but we’re also optimising for translational plausibility. SynNotch is cool and all but yet to make it to the clinic.
Also logic gates still leaky as hell haha
[25/02/2026, 13:25:32] ~ Haziq: Also lemme remind you that CAR T is already half a million dollars per treatment haha so you add any other apparatus and cost blows up even more, we want the minimum viable product that’s broadly accessible
[25/02/2026, 13:26:56] ~ Haziq: And also sir this is women’s health research
I work in a lab that looks like haunted factory with two dollar bills to rub together
Ain’t nobody got cash for spatial freaking transcriptomics

Assuming we’re doing dual targeting CAR…
how many pairs of cell surface markers are there in total do you reckon? Wondering if we can brute force all of them if we run it for a week
[25/02/2026, 15:18:34] ~ Haziq: Alternatively there’s genetic algorithms or this one weird trick with sparse auto encoders to efficiently search through combinatorial spaces

[25/02/2026, 19:01:25] ~ Haziq: quick intro: it’s a synthetic biology / genetic engineering competition, very serious actually (although they did lose some credibility when they picked my team as winner last year)
[25/02/2026, 19:02:00] ~ Haziq: this is literally how Maverick Metals started btw, they probably also had a GC like this just fooling about before winning iGEM startups and then going to YC and raising some 17 million $ seed
[25/02/2026, 19:03:43] ~ Haziq: but FYI this is NOT a serious team, we’re doing this for fun and glory and to draw some attention to bioengineering in an OB GYN context
so if you have biotech billionaire dreams then *sir this is a wendys*
[25/02/2026, 19:04:18] ~ Haziq: that’s all from me

[25/02/2026, 19:09:07] ~ Haziq: https://youtube.com/shorts/aCR9e2_5PlQ?si=TRGu2-RDd3pVvazN
this is me rn
[25/02/2026, 19:15:01] ~ Filipo: Hey, nice to meet you all :). I did just want to ask, what kind of prior knowledge/skills might be required for the iGem? Is there anywhere that a first year undergrad could help out? I’m pretty happy just spectating and learning how the discussions work for this, but still wanted to check
[25/02/2026, 19:39:41] ~ TS: You could help with data mining and literature reviews if you would like, or whatever anyone else suggests.
[25/02/2026, 19:40:14] ~ TS: There are roughly 2,800 to 3,000 validated human cell-surface proteins (Bausch-Fluck et al., 2018). 3000 choose 2 it's about 4.5m pairs approx. You can try to brute force it, on a standard HPC cluster / a GPU-accelerated  high-end workstation using NumPy / CuPy I would say 4.5m is pretty inconsequential. But you're right, sparse autoencoder is good. 
​So instead of picking markers because they have a high fold change, we use the SAE to find the latent features which define the ectopic state. So Effectively we find the markers which don't belong in the healthy uterine context. We can use SAE to narrow down to top 50-100 markers.   Great work by the way.
[25/02/2026, 19:13:44] ~ Haziq: ‎~ Haziq changed this group's icon
[25/02/2026, 20:04:23] ~ Haziq: Hey filipo, great to have you here!! How are you enjoying our team so far??
No prior knowledge needed per se, in fact iGEM is most people’s first exposure to bioengineering so you’re in the right place 🤝
This part of iGEM startups is mostly dry lab, design, pitching
If you want to get involved in the computation / data side then i can suggest some resources. alternatively if you want to make slide decks, help with the pitching and presentation side then that’s cool as well
[25/02/2026, 20:09:14] ~ Ada Ge: I for one would like to know more about the computation side
[25/02/2026, 20:09:26] ~ Haziq: Oh damn 4.5 million 😅 tysm for doing the math, im not so concerned about brute forcing on the human endometrium atlas as i am about brute forcing against tabula sapiens ☠️ but i suppose only a small subset of pairs will survive the first selection (ectopic positive, eutopic negative within endometrial stomal cells). in any case i will try to benchmark this asap on my PC.
Also re SAE i actually have a really quirky trick in mind hehe inspired by the differentiable optimisation literature that i used for some of my work at Arc. i will try to elaborate as i get home, dont wanna type and die
[25/02/2026, 21:33:15] ~ Haziq: Btw no way you said HPC cluster 😭🤣
This is the sorta compute we have access to at the EGA-IfWH: https://youtube.com/shorts/p1R9mpezxh0?si=zkBlIgJV3EMGZim6
[25/02/2026, 21:40:26] ~ Haziq: hi ada!!! 
ok anyone interested in the computational side please come study the dark arts that is single cell transcriptomics analysis. big words but genuinely not complicated at all. if i can do it the bar is under the central line at holborn and we’re still digging

try the mitx quantitative biology workshop 🔥
[25/02/2026, 21:42:25] abdurrahman: We need to create a workflow to plan whose doing what and how everything's going to work
[25/02/2026, 21:42:50] abdurrahman: Things feel very messy right now
[25/02/2026, 21:50:04] ~ Haziq: no no no absolutely not. nobody be serious on my watch. entropy is part of the process. things will self organise
[25/02/2026, 21:50:20] abdurrahman: 😭
[25/02/2026, 21:56:02] ~ Haziq: btw @⁨~Ada Ge⁩ competition is only next month so until then please feel free to use this gc for philosophy of biology discourse and origin of life takes for old times’ sake. this is a safe space for abiogenesis
[25/02/2026, 21:57:47] ~ Haziq: i for one reject the igem / arc institute dogma of biology as programmable. i come from the dennis noble lineage of systems biology (ray noble is with us at the IfWH actually, no kidding) and we do not subscribe to genetic determinism or central dogma maximalism. reverse causality and top down control are real. bioelectric patterning says hello.

biology as physics is spiritually more correct
[25/02/2026, 22:02:28] ~ Haziq: ok intro to our project for the new ppl *1\* so car-t cells are basically immune cells that we genetically modify to recognise specific cell surface markers and then eliminate whatever is expressing them
[25/02/2026, 22:03:50] ~ Haziq: *2\* we’re looking at using this logic in the endometriosis context. idea being: identify a combination of cell surface markers that are consistently present in ectopic endometrial lesions but not in healthy uterine or normal tissue then engineer a dual-target CAR that only activates when both markers are expressed
[25/02/2026, 22:08:10] ~ Ada Ge: hell yeah!
[25/02/2026, 22:08:10] ~ Haziq: *3/* this would actually be useful in endometriosis because right now the main intervention is surgical resection (once the progestins stop responding) which is respectfully half baked and has high recurrence rates. surgeons literally cannot reliably distinguish all pathological tissue from healthy tissue just by visual inspection
[25/02/2026, 22:13:20] ~ Haziq: https://youtu.be/hMzfGZnaPN8?si=qiwwEuEfEFv-s4yr
i dont like huberman but that was actually a good interview. legendary gyn surgeon explaining why endometriosis surgery is so difficult. but she gets the biology all wrong (typical clinician behaviour, sorry @⁨~Yi Hein⁩ ), aint nobody thinks endometriosis is cos of reverse menstruation in 2026
[25/02/2026, 22:14:23] ~ Haziq: ok i think that concludes the intro. welcome to the synthetic biology burger chain north of russell square

[26/02/2026, 00:55:52] ~ Haziq: ok here’s my “reparameterisation trick”
the whole idea behind differentiable optimisation is to take an ugly discrete combinatorial problem and replace it with an analytical approximation so we can solve it cheaply with backprop and gradient descent
[26/02/2026, 00:56:18] ~ Haziq: so we relax it into a continuous space with something like gumbel softmax, optimise the relaxed objective and then snap it back to a hard discrete solution at inference

[26/02/2026, 01:08:17] ~ Haziq: this actually worked quite well for designing optimal flow cytometry panels from scRNA-seq.

ok @⁨~TS⁩ i know you’re judging me for discretising gene expression but threshold sensitive CARs (like https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.21.427654v1.full) are very very far from the clinic so for all practical purposes CAR activation is binary

yes yes i can hear the question already what about technical dropout and zero inflated negative binomial...

thats why i’m thinking we denoise with scVI-VAE first and then binarise the posterior expression estimates instead of raw counts / log1p
[26/02/2026, 01:09:47] ~ Haziq: what do y’all think. computationally i feel like we’re actually looking pretty solid??
[26/02/2026, 01:26:51] ~ Haziq: are we cooking or is the grill not even on
[26/02/2026, 06:26:36] ~ TS: Great idea! Melting CPU problem is avoided. So you would make a differentiable engine which will subtract the healthy human body from the endometriosis lesion to find the mathematically optimal CAR T pair if we are on same page. I’m with you on scVI-VAE. We should probably set a infinite penalty for any markers expressed in the heart or lungs within the Tabula Sapiens dataset even if they’re perfect for the lesion. If the gradient descent spits out a top 5 list, I can start looking into the bench top feasibility for those scFvs if you would like me to.
[26/02/2026, 06:35:58] ~ Haziq: thank you!! yesssss spot on and wow bench top feasibility already… you’re fast 😅 ok now i cannot slack any longer. lemme get this in silico target discovery engine thing up and running ASAP and send over targets, tissue-specific risk profiles etc

most senior OB GYN clinician scientist in the country and has made huge progress across every part of the pipeline from pre clinical research to building translational research programmes

she’s the one actively bringing interdisciplinary approaches into this field. her own research is cutting edge on in-utero prenatal gene therapy

and on top of that she frequently travels to the global south to train doctors and advise hospitals doing obstetrics in under resourced conditions
i think she’s literally in Uganda right now ‎<This message was edited>
